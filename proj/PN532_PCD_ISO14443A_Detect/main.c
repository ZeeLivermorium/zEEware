 * @file ISO14443A_Detect.c
 * @brief Detect Mifare/ISO14443A card and serial output(UART) the UID.
 * ----------
 * Adapted code from Seeed Studio PN532 driver for Arduino.
 * You can find the Seeed Studio PN532 driver here: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532
 * ----------
 * Inspired by examples in ValvanoWareTM4C123 by Dr. Jonathan Valvano
 * as well as his book Embedded Systems: Real-Time Interfacing to Arm Cortex-M Microcontrollers
 * You can find ValvanoWareTM4C123 at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/ValvanoWareTM4C123.zip?dl=1
